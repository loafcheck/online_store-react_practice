we can specify the links in react with three different ways
1. pure html reference
2. link
3. nav.link

📍html
pure html reference is a typical anchor link element, 
so when we click the link the whole application is reloaded from the beginning 
so it is no effective in react

📍link vs nav.link
link and nav.link are similar in React.
nav.link gives us a couple of additional things.
we can add in here active class name and 
that will automatically tie your css class to current url
